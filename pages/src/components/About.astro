      <p class="mb-6">
        I’m a <strong>Data Scientist with a strong engineering mindset</strong>, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how complex systems work, whether that system is a machine learning pipeline, a product testing process, or a web application.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        My path into tech wasn’t linear. I began in <strong>Sport Science and Education</strong>, where I learned how to break down complex skills, analyze performance, and communicate clearly under real-world constraints. These foundations now shape how I approach data problems: methodical, iterative, and always grounded in feedback and measurable outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Today, I’m completing a <strong>Master’s in Applied Information and Data Science</strong> in Switzerland and gaining hands-on industry experience through roles at <strong>ON AG</strong> and <strong>Mammut AG</strong>. My work has ranged from building ML models for operational decision-making to analyzing physical product performance data to support quality and innovation.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I’m particularly motivated by problems that sit at the intersection of <strong>data, engineering, and real-world impact</strong>, where insights must be robust, explainable, and useful beyond a dashboard. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and translating technical results into decisions people can trust.
