        I've always been fascinated by computers—the infinite content, the creativity, and the power to build anything from scratch. What started as simple curiosity ("this webpage should have this feature", "this game is missing that element") evolved into a deeper desire to <em>create</em>, <em>optimize</em>, and <em>understand</em> how things work under the hood.

        From my background in Education and Sport Science, I learned how to break down complex skills, analyze performance, and communicate effectively. I realized these skills transfer perfectly to technology: whether I'm optimizing a machine learning model or debugging a web application, the core principle is the same—iterative improvement based on data and feedback.
