## Professional Overview

This role was based within the Quality Management department at **Mammut Sports Group AG**, focusing on the modernization of data pipelines and the rigorous testing of technical mountain sports equipment. The position involved bridging the gap between physical laboratory testing and digital data architecture, ensuring that product safety and manufacturing standards were met across global supply chains.

### Data Infrastructure & ERP Migration

A primary objective was maintaining data integrity during a large-scale transition of the company’s digital backbone.

* **ERP Migration:** Managed the update of the quality database during the migration from a legacy system to **Microsoft Dynamics 365**. This included reconfiguring standalone programs and files that relied on specific database entries to ensure zero data loss.
* **Database Management:** Leveraged **Microsoft SQL** and **Excel** to clean and pipeline testing data from laboratory servers to central storage, ensuring that historical records remained accessible and standardized.
* **Documentation:** Centralized all technical SOPs, testing protocols, and migration logs on **SharePoint**, creating a unified "source of truth" for the global quality team.

### Automation & Strategic Reporting

To improve operational speed, several manual reporting processes were replaced with automated workflows within the **Microsoft Stack**:

* **Provider Reporting:** Automated the generation and distribution of quality reports to external providers. This replaced a manual process, ensuring that manufacturers received performance feedback and defect alerts instantly.
* **Internal KPI Dashboards:** Updated and automated the reporting of internal Quality KPIs sent company-wide via **Power BI**. These dashboards provided real-time visibility into production health and material performance.
* **Project Tracking:** Created specialized dashboards for individual product projects, allowing key stakeholders to monitor production progress, identify quality-related delays, and address issues before they reached the warehouse.


## Crisis Management: The Skywalker Pro Recall

The role involved a central contribution to one of the company's most significant safety initiatives: the global recall of the **Skywalker Pro Via Ferrata Set**.

### The Investigation

During routine safety monitoring and stress testing, a potential malfunction was identified in the carabiner’s automatic locking mechanism.

* **Defect Confirmation:** Instrumental in the laboratory testing phase that confirmed the issue. Through rigorous environmental testing, it was proven that the locking function could fail in cooler temperatures, posing a serious fall hazard.
* **Global Task Force:** Served as a key technical member of the international task force formed to resolve the crisis. This involved a massive team effort across engineering, legal, and logistics departments in multiple countries.
* **Data-Driven Response:** Used the newly migrated database to help the task force identify affected batches (specifically 07/2021 and 11/2022). This ensured the recall was targeted and effective, protecting Mammut's users while maintaining brand trust.

## Results

* **Successful ERP Transition:** Ensured a seamless data migration to Dynamics 365, keeping all quality-dependent programs functional during a critical infrastructure shift.
* **Global Safety Impact:** The confirmation of the Skywalker defect led to a proactive global recall, preventing potential accidents through data-backed laboratory evidence.
* **Efficiency Gains:** Automated reporting saved significant weekly hours for the Quality team, allowing them to focus on high-level analysis rather than manual data entry.
