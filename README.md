## About me

### 🔥 Motivation

Computers always attracted my attention, all the information and endless content, programs and games to discover were amazing.
After a while, it became a common thing to think about (without any technical knowledge) how I would have done it: this game is missing this, this webpage misses that feature, etc.

So it was more and more exciting to have the skills to one day be able to make those changes or create something from scratch.

> The programmers of tomorrow are the _wizards of the future_.

> It is the closest thing we have to **super powers**.

### 🖥️ The Web Developer Way

As a kid I always loved videogames and computers, but also outdoors and sports.
I finally decided to go for a Sport Science degree and a Masters in Education and Teaching.

Had my time and experience as a teacher, and it was wonderful, a bit stressful but other than that pretty enjoyable and rewarding.

After deciding to move abroad to 🇨🇭 **Switzerland**, I started a journey to teach myself **Full Stack Web Development**, and found an amazing open source curriculum: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)

That was early 2022, and after a bit more than a year of studying, reading, watching and following tutorials and doing some projects, I have finally finished the curriculum and ready to move on to the industry.

### 🔨 Jack of All Trades

As mentioned before, I got a Bachelor's and Master's degree and self education in Web Development.
But even before that, I have been so many things...
My entire adult life has beeen full of part-time and summer touching **a lot of areas**, here are some of those:

- Open Source contributor
- Physical Education Teacher
- Software translator
- Construction worker
- Swimming instructor
- Bike mechanic
- Kitchen help

And then some more. It was a incredible and bumpy ride, but now it's time to settle down in something more creative and specific.
And none of those have been wasted time, in every one I have learnt valuable lessons and skills that brought me to be who I am today
